  Ugh, bios! It is so hard to convey in a few hundred words who I am. I’m not
  some list of accomplishments that check off this box or that. I’m a Gen X’er
  through and through, and we have a severe aversion to people who take
  themselves too seriously. We’re grungey. We’re not boomers. We may be small in
  number, but we’re also not ready to fade off into the sunset. I’m here to make
  my mark.

So instead of my CV, I’d like to share a few moments that have shaped my life and gotten me to this point. They may not be pretty, but they’re mine, and I think reveal my character better than this degree or that award. We all know making films is a big leap of faith. To make great work, and that’s always been my goal, we have to really trust each other. So if you want to know who I am - read on. If you want to read my accomplishments (no judgment): you can see my [CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qgc6gsh15xcVVQldT7amItfO_zKfcPHZV7NJVRM5Bto).

At 13, on the day I became a Bat Mitzvah in front of an enormous congregation of my family and friends, I chanted Torah, gave my speech, and then as the Rabbi was blessing me, I barfed. Thankfully, not on the Rabbi (though his stale pipe-smoking breath made it tempting) but I mean projectile puke that went across a large swath of the bimah. I ran off in tears and my mother found me in the bathroom sobbing. She looked me in the eyes with compassion and said, I am so proud of you. She shored me up, helped me get the vomit off my blue taffeta dress, and I went right back out there, embarrassed but determined not to let this humiliate me, or stop me.

I think it’s one of my more remarkable traits, the ability to pick myself up, get on with things.

Sophomore year at college, I got really sick with mono. I have no doubt one of the reasons I got so sick was because I was taking an insane course load. I hadn’t grown up in Little Rock, Arkansas (valedictorian of Central High School’s Class of ‘89 Go Tigers!) to get all the way to Stanford University not to take my studies seriously. I wanted to understand one simple thing: why does war exist? I was a child of the 80s and we were beginning to process Vietnam through our films. Oliver Stone’s PLATOON and Stanley Kubrick’s FULL METAL JACKET had made a huge impression on me. So I studied International Relations and learned from many of those on the front lines of American foreign policy: Condoleezza Rice, George Schultz, Stephen Krasner, Peter Bernstein. It was literally making me sick. So I stopped out, took incompletes and went home to Little Rock to heal. It was there that I decided I didn’t want to be part of the war-making / perpetuating system. I want to be part of a creative life of filmmakers who make us think. Not tell us what to think (that’s fascism) but get us to think, ideally, before we act and maybe just maybe change our lives.

> In short, it's the tale of a woman who becomes the PROTAGONIST of her own story.

In the early 90s, Stanford had no film program, and I was very tempted to bail on college. But I knew that would kill my parents. And I believe in finishing what I start. So I went back to Stanford, and proceeded to finish my degree in four quarters straight leaving a required semester abroad as my only remaining credits.

This is how I got to Prague. I saw a flyer in the quad offering a study abroad semester at FAMU through American University. I went, ready to leave my college days behind and see if this film dream I’d had one feverish night during my mono recovery was for real.

I’ll let ALEXIA speak for itself. Bottom line, I’d never been happier in my life. It felt like a total marriage of my right and left brains, and I’ve been pursuing this dream of writing - directing ever since. 

It took twenty years to make my second film. Why you may wonder? Because for one thing my father said never go into debt to make a film, it’s a terrible investment. He was a Finance professor, so he knew what he was talking about. The American Indie film movement was taking off (this was the 90s) but I wasn’t Tarantino, Soderbergh, Rodriguez or Linklater. I also wasn’t Allison Anders, Jane Campion, or Agnieska Holland though their work inspired me so much! So I decided to focus on my writing since I could do that for free. I got a job in the Bay Area as an executive recruiter and learned the business ropes. This was ‘99 when the Internet was blowing up. I was really good at recruiting. I can talk to anyone about anything, and I’m good at getting folks to talk to me.

I had no idea how well that would serve me, but it did. I’ve been able to support myself while also getting my MFA in creative writing (for craft!), getting married, having children, teaching screenwriting in film school, and making my other short films.

Do you see how much I don’t quit? Here’s another example. 

Donald Rae and I started writing WELCOME TO THE FISHBOWL in 2010 (it was called “We’ll Always Have Paris” back then). We have picked it up and put it down many times over the last decade. Each time we return to it, it has become more and more personal. Then last year, 2019, I finally figured out what the story was trying to say to me.

Does a fish know it’s in a bowl? Who can say? But in middle age it’s easy to forget how to take risks, to believe in change and opportunity. So this script is about saying fishbowl I see you and I’m not going to let you stop me. Because we actually aren’t fish, these walls are in our minds. 

We’re ready to make this film.

It’s time for a 50 YO woman to lead a film about becoming the protagonist of her own story. Even though she’s married, even though she has children. We need a society that allows each of us to give our gifts no matter our age, our pasts, or whether we’ve been traditionally allowed to hold such power.

That’s what FISHBOWL is about.

That’s what my life is about.
