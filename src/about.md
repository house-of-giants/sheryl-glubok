  Ugh, bios! It is so hard to convey in a few hundred words who I am. I’m not
  some list of accomplishments that check off this box or that. I’m a Gen X’er
  through and through, and we have a severe aversion to people who take
  themselves too seriously. We’re grungey. We’re not boomers. We may be small in
  number, but we’re also not ready to fade off into the sunset. I’m here to make
  my mark.

Instead, I’d like to share a few moments that have shaped my life and gotten me here. They may not be pretty, but they’re mine, and I think reveal my character better than this degree or that award. We all know making films is a big ol' leap into the arms of the universe. To make great work, and that’s always been my goal, we have to really trust each other. So if you want to know who I am - read on.

At 13, on the day I became a Bat Mitzvah in front of an enormous congregation of my family and friends, I chanted Torah, gave my speech, and then as the Rabbi was blessing me, I barfed. Thankfully, not on the Rabbi (though his stale pipe-smoking breath made it tempting) but I mean projectile puke that went across a large swath of the bimah. I ran off in tears and my mother found me in the bathroom sobbing. She looked me in the eyes with compassion and said, I am so proud of you. She shored me up, helped me get the vomit off my blue taffeta dress, and I went right back out there, embarrassed but determined not to let this humiliate me, or stop me.

I think it’s one of my more remarkable traits, the ability to pick myself up and get on with things.

Sophomore year at college, I got super sick with mono. No doubt one of the reasons was because I was taking an insane course load. I hadn’t grown up in Little Rock, Arkansas to get all the way to Stanford not to take all the classes I could. I wanted to understand one simple thing: why does war exist? I was a child of the 80s and we were beginning to process Vietnam through our movies. Oliver Stone’s PLATOON and Stanley Kubrick’s FULL METAL JACKET had made huge impressions on me. So I studied International Relations and learned from many of those on the front lines of American foreign policy: Condoleezza Rice, George Schultz, Stephen Krasner. It was literally making me sick. So I stopped out, took incompletes and went home to Little Rock to heal. It was there that I decided I didn’t want to be part of the war-perpetuating system. I want to be part of a creative life of filmmakers who make us think. Not tell us what to think (that’s fascist) but get us to think, ideally, before we act and maybe just maybe change our lives.

> I think it’s one of my more remarkable traits, the ability to pick myself up and get on with things.

In the early 90s, Stanford had no film program, and I was very tempted to bail on college. But I knew that would just kill my parents. And I believe in finishing what I start. So I went back to school and proceeded to finish my degree in four quarters straight leaving only a required semester abroad.

This is how I got to Prague. I saw a flyer in the quad from American University offering a study abroad semester at FAMU. I went, ready to leave my college days behind and see if this film dream I’d had one feverish night during my mono recovery was for real.

I’ll let my first film, ALEXIA, speak for itself. Bottom line, I’d never been happier in my life. It felt like a total marriage of my right and left brain, and I’ve been pursuing this dream of writing - directing ever since. 

It took twenty years to make my second film. Why you may wonder? One reason was that my father said never go into debt to make a movie because it’s a terrible investment. He was a finance professor, so he knew what he was talking about. Another was that I didn't see myself reflected the pantheon of the American Indie film movement that was taking off. I wasn’t Tarantino, Soderbergh, Rodriguez or Linklater. 

So I decided to focus on writing since I could do that for free, and follow my father's other piece of advice: get a job! So I did, as an executive recruiter in the Bay Area and learned the business ropes. This was ‘99 when the Internet was blowing up. I was really good at recruiting. I can talk to anyone about anything, and I’m good at getting folks to talk to me.

I had no idea how well that would serve me, but it did. I’ve been able to support myself financially while also completing my MFA in fiction, getting married, having children, teaching screenwriting, and making my other short films.

Do you see how much I don’t quit? Here’s another example. 

Donald Rae and I started writing the feature script WELCOME TO THE FISHBOWL in 2011 (it was called “We’ll Always Have Paris” back then). We have picked it up and put it down many times over the last decade. Each time we return to it, it has become more and more personal. Then last year, 2019, I finally figured out what the story was trying to say to me.

Does a fish know it’s in a bowl? Who can say? But in middle age it’s easy to forget how to take risks, to believe in change and opportunity. So this script is about saying, "Fishbowl I see you and I’m not going to let you stop me." Because we aren’t actually fish, these walls are only in our minds. 

We’re ready to make this film.

It’s time for a 50 YO woman to helm a movie about becoming the protagonist of her own story. Even though she’s married, even though she has children. We need a society that allows each of us to give our gifts no matter our age, our pasts, or whether we’ve been traditionally allowed to hold such power.

That’s what FISHBOWL is about.

That’s what my life is about.
