Growing up Jewish in Arkansas and as an only child, I often felt most at home in the movies I watched every weekend with my parents. My fondest memories are the three of us guffawing (especially my dad who would almost stop breathing he was laughing so hard) at the antics of Peter Sellers in “The Pink Panthers” and all of those comedies for grownups they used to make with Goldie Hawn (“Private Benjamin” my first R movie!), Bill Murray (OMG “Stripes”), Steve Martin and Lily Tomlin (remember “All of Me”?).

Movies were my window into other worlds and ways of being. I didn’t learn about Ghandi in school, I learned about him in Richard Attenborough’s 1982 film. My parents didn’t teach me about teen relationships, John Hughes did.

Then I get to college and my love of Milan Kundera novels hooks me on Eastern European cinema and next thing you know I’m making my very first film at FAMU in Prague and deciding I want to be a filmmaker.

It’s easy to have dreams, it’s hard to turn your passion into a career.

That road’s taken me to production work in NY, LA, and Arkansas (“Sling Blade” was a dream), spec script-writing in LA, a MFA in Fiction from Bennington which led me to teaching screenwriting at Burlington College, to making three more short films, and now the making of my first feature.

I thought I’d do this by 30. It’s taken a bit longer. Because if you want to carve your own path, you need to know what you want to say and how you want to say it. The elusive “finding your voice.” It’s been hard, not because I wasn’t aware of my voice, rather it’s so damn difficult to trust it.

I don’t know why. You’d think it’d be the easiest thing, listening to yourself. It’s also craft. That may be another post.

At its heart WELCOME TO THE FISHBOWL is about the journey to self-belief. Often what keeps us back is not other people (convenient if that were true) but our own internal narratives. Donald Rae and I start our screenplay with a quote from essayist Rebecca Solnit: “We are our stories, stories that can be both prison and the crowbar to break open the door of that prison…”

What are the stories we tell ourselves that keep us from living our best lives? That’s the fishbowl.
