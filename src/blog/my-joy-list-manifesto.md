I've always wanted to write a manifesto. So here goes...

Because:

\- This pandemic era makes time so hard to keep track of (#blursday is real);

\- There are still many wonderful moments of art/literature/music culture that I want to remember;

\- When 1 year feels like 10 years, doing some end-of-year Top 10 list seems so arbitrary;

Thus, I'm going to try to keep a weekly joy list.

HOWEVER, I will only do these lists if I feel like it, we have enough have-to's #MoreJoy).

Joy List 1/17/21

HONEYLAND - (HULU) - I'd had this 2019 documentary on my To Watch list for a year. So glad I finally watched it! Following the last female beekeeper in Europe to use ancient methods like singing(!) to care for the hive and harvest honey sustainably, it's a revelation on so many levels. Shot over three years in Northern Macedonia, this beautifully captured film reveals that when life is stripped to its essence there will always be death, conflict, love, and beauty.

LET THEM ALL TALK (HBO Max) - Steven Soderbergh's latest had it all for me: wonderful acting, a literary script in the best sense of the word (depth of character without pandering) written by one of America's best short story writers, Deborah Eisenberg, and an ensemble where everyone played in the same key and harmonized beautifully. Oh and it was so fun to cross the Atlantic on the Queen Mary 2.

SABRINA & CORINA by Kali Fajardo-Anstine - This collection of short stories had also been on my list since I learned about it last year. Fajardo-Anstine is a Denver-based writer and her debut collection is both unsettling and artful as she shows us the too often overlooked lives of the Latina women in Colorado. It's a well-deserved finalist for National Book Award.

BOB MOULD'S BLUE HEARTS - I’ve loved Bob from the 80s when I used to blast Hüsker Dü driving around Little Rock in my white Honda Accord. I only got to see him live once (Roseland, NYC, 1993) and my ears are still ringing. His latest album is excellent. Check out tracks "American Crisis" and "Forecast of Rain" to see how something can be both vintage and relevant.

LUPIN (NETFLIX) - A series about a Senegalese-French gentleman thief seeking to avenge his father's death which he believes is the result of a wealthy family the father used to work for. Just saw first two episodes, but I'm hooked. Come for the beautiful shots of Paris, stay for Omar Sy's playful acting and a mystery done with heart, soul, and panache.

Wonder what I’ll discover this week? (Yes our cat Little Stripe is going to be a permanent feature on this list :)
