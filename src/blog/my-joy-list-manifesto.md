I've always wanted to write a manifesto and I have a feeling this may be one of many. But here goes:

Because...

\- this pandemic era makes time so hard to keep track of (#blursday is real);

\- I'm finding so many wonderful moments of art/literature/music culture that I'm losing track;

\- When we live 10 years for every year, doing some end-of-year Top 10 list seems so arbitrary;

I'm going to try to keep track of things weekly. For me to help keep track of things, perhaps you'll feel like chiming in. It's up to all of us to #spreadJoy and whew do we need it more than ever.

(NOTE: each of these experiences happened in the last week so dating this 1/17/21 means I watched/read/listened in the last 7 days AND I will only do these lists if I feel like it, we have enough have-to's #MoreJoy).

The Joy List 1/17/2021

1. HONEYLAND - (HULU) - I'd had this 2019 documentary on my To Watch list for a year. So glad I finally watched it! Following the last female beekeeper in Europe to use ancient methods like singing! to care for the hive and harvest honey sustainably, it's a revelation on so many levels.  Shot over three years in Northern Macedonia, this beautifully captured film reveals that when life is stripped to its  essence there will still be always be death, conflict,  love, and beauty.
2. LET THEM ALL TALK (HBO Max) - Steven Soderbergh's latest had it all for me: wonderful acting, a literary script in the best sense of the word (depth of character without pandering) written by one of America's best short story writers, Deborah Eisenberg, and an ensemble where everyone played in the same key and harmonized beautifully. Oh and it was so fun to be aboard the Queen Mary 2 virtually crossing the ocean on a such a lovely boat.
3. SABRINA & CORINA by Kali Fajardo-Anstine - This collection of short stories had also been on my list since I learned about it last year. Fajardo-Anstine is a Denver-based writer and her debut collection is both unsettling and artful as she shows us the too often overlooked lives of the Latina women in Colorado. It's a  well-deserved finalist for National Book Award.
4. BOB MOULD'S BLUE HEARTS - I've been a fan of Bob from the 80s when I used to blast *Hüsker Dü* driving around Little Rock in my white Honda Accord. I only got to see him live once, Roseland, NYC, 1993, and I swear my ears are still ringing. His latest album is excellent. Check out tracks "American Crisis" and "Forecast of Rain" to see how something can be both vintage and relevant.
5. LUPIN (NETFLIX) - A series about a Senegalese-French gentleman thief seeking to avenge his father's death who he believes is a result of a wealthy family he used to work for. Just saw first two episodes but I'm hooked. Come for the beautiful shots of Paris, stay for Omar Sy's playful acting and mystery done with heart, soul, and panache.
