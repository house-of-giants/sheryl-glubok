I hope this post finds you well - as well as can be expected in this crazy fucking time. I won't lie and say I’m not scared of what may happen. There has been and will be much loss. I also know that we have to keep going and that when we do finally reach the other side of this, if nothing else we'll all be more keenly aware that it’s now or never to do whatever it is we came here to do.

In that spirit, my fellow creative conspirators co-writer Donald Rae, producers Iana Dontcheva, Sterling Cook, and I are kicking off a blog series chronicling our journey making a movie - a full length, set in Colorado feature!

WELCOME TO THE FISHBOWL is a screwball road comedy about coming-of-middle age while refusing to stay in the middle of the road. 

See when I hit 40, once I got over the shock, I had a feeling of dread about what was next. Where were the goals that used to be my sign posts? Some had been accomplished (college, grad school, marriage, kids!), many had not (directing a feature, writing and publishing a novel!). The nagging question was did they still even matter anymore? To me, much less to anyone else?

When I was younger it was easy to dream. To think of all the things I’d do, the places I’d go, the people I’d meet. You hit middle age and no one’s really asking you that anymore. It’s more like just ride out whatever wave you’re on until you hit social security.

I have never been satisfied with that notion. So WELCOME TO THE FISHBOWL was born.

In our story Donald and I explore the book ends of middle age via two couples - one in their early 40s (Gen X’rs Elizabeth and Peter) one in the early 60s (Boomers Storm and Vivian) while also tackling Success (who defines it, what does it look like) and self-actualization in a world that isn't that interested in whether you do you or you don’t.

I think this last bit may be especially true for women where it’s easy to feel that as our ovaries expire and our breasts droop, so too does our social currency. The main role we’re expected (allowed) to play is as caregivers and nurturers of others’ dreams.

Not that I don’t enjoy that. It’s just, it’s not all I’m good for.

Over the months, maybe years, that it takes to make our movie, we'll be sharing our experience with you. We hope you’ll enjoy being part of the ride.
