I’m just gonna say it: Hollywood doesn’t know how to make movies for women.

Or to crib one of our character's lines from our screenplay when challenged as to whether he can actually drive, “I don’t know if I don’t know, I’ve never tried.”

In that spirit, I’ll rephrase: I don’t think Hollywood has ever tried very hard to make movies for women.

This idea started forming back in 2008 when a group of friends and I went to see “Sex in the City” The Movie. Despite the terrible reviews, we were so excited. And despite being disappointed by the movie, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.

But the truly telling detail was the previews. It’s been twelve years and I still remember them or rather the lack of them. There were exactly 3 (not 10 like you’d get before a summer action movie) and all seemed completely random, not at all of interest to the women who were seated in that theater.

It’s not to say that sometimes Hollywood hasn’t gotten lucky, see “Bridesmaids” and “Booksmart.” But then you get “Where’d You Go Bernadette?” Such a great novel, and a rare one starring a woman in her 40s, and yet it totally didn’t work as a movie.

I have my suspicions as to why.

They hired the wrong people to make it.

For those who don’t know the story, it’s about an architect, Bernadette, who no longer works but instead sublimates herself to her husband and daughter. Bernadette is depressed and isolated in a rambling old mansion that she’s given up ever trying to fix. You could say it represents how she’s given up on herself.

But guess who Hollywood first hired to write the screenplay? The young men who wrote “(500) Days of Summer”! I happened to see them talk about it at the Austin Film Fest and they were in their early 30s.

Now “(500) Days of Summer” was a funny subversion of the rom com told from a young man’s POV. But what did they know about being a perimenopausal woman who feels washed up?

Eventually they hired Richard Linklater to co-write and direct the movie. Again nothing against Linklater - I’ve loved so many of his films - but they center male lives. And yes, he’s had some amazing collaborations with actresses who brought fully dimensional female characters to the screen, namely Patricia Arquette in “Boyhood” and Julie Delpy who co-wrote the “Before” series.

So the question remains, where are the entertaining films that deal with the reality of women’s lives, told by women, and in particular, women in midlife?

I’m making WELCOME TO THE FISHBOWL because it’s the movie I want to see. I want catharsis and laughter. I want to show the absurdity of how often we get in our own way and what happens when male narcissism bumps into female sublimation.

I want to make a movie where a woman in her 40s who is a wife, a mother, and a writer figures out how to become the protagonist of her own story.

So we’re going to make this one. I know a lot of women who will line up to see it.
