While making THAW we decided to move to Colorado, the place I was born, but hadn’t lived since I was nine months old. I met a lovely group of filmmakers at 7 & CO and an actress named Maggy Stacy. Add one Shakespeare Sonnet and the crazy brainchild of Theater critic John Moore who wanted to make a short film for every Shakespeare sonnet (154!) to showcase local actors and voila, SONNET 98 was born. When I read the sonnet, [From you have I been absent in the spring…](http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sonnets/98.html)” I immediately identified that longing as heartbreak. Maggy thought it would be fun to set it in a nightclub and damn if the Bard didn’t just work there. A lesson again in the timelessness of heartache, longing, and the need for love.

[Sunboy](https://m.facebook.com/sunboy/) was a fabulous band I’d seen at Denver’s indie music showcase, UMS, and Materialize is such a good song. They let us film a concert before their new album release “Yesterday Is In Love With You” at Jonathan Bitz’s legendary Syntax Physics Opera. It as a blast.
