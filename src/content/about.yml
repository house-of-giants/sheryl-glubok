  Ugh, bios! It is so hard to convey in a few hundred words who I am. I’m not
  some list of accomplishments that check off this box or that. I’m a Gen X’er
  through and through, and we have a severe aversion to people who take
  themselves too seriously. We’re grungey. We’re not boomers. We may be small in
  number, but we’re also not ready to fade off into the sunset. I’m here to make
  my mark.
